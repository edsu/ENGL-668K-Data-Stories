my data story

My data story examines Cristiano Ronaldo's twitter activity to explore how the famous soccer player interacts with his fans. Though I am by no means an excel expert, I was able to make a series of pivot tables that isolate @usernames, time and date of tweets, and the text of tweets for further analysis. 
First, to see how Cristiano Ronaldo engages with his followers on twitter, I made a pivot table of the replies to each username, which I called "replies to username" on the spreadsheet. At first glance, it seems like Ronaldo spends a lot of time responding to his fans. From approximately 800 tweets, 77 were replies to other twitter users, or about one for every ten tweets. By creating a "value" column, I also noticed that Ronaldo rarely replies to the same user twice. In a space of nearly two years, Ronaldo only tweeted the same user -- JensonButton -- more than once. JensonButton's user page indicates that he is a racecar driver based on Monaco with his own massive twitter following of over 2 million. This user's visibility may be a reason why Ronaldo engaged in a conversation with him, rather than responding once to a tweet. It seems that, when interacting with his followers, Ronaldo aims for scope rather than depth. By this, I mean that he prefers to send single tweets to as many followers as possible than send multiple tweets to a smaller group of followers. 
Given this insight, I next wanted to know the nature of the interactions Ronaldo has with his fans -- that is, what Ronaldo talks about in his messages to followers. To figure this out, I had to look at the text of the tweets themselves. Because I'm not very experienced with excel, I could not isolate the tweets that were replies to followers, so I had to create a pivot table containing the text from the entire sample of 800 tweets, which I called "text of tweets" on the spreadsheet.
On the text of the tweets -- he seems to follow a specific foruma.
On tweet times -- he addresses his followers in chunks, and this also adhears to a formula.
