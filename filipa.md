My data story examines Cristiano Ronaldo's twitter activity (@cristiano) to explore how the famous soccer player interacts with his fans. Though I am by no means an excel expert, I was able to make a series of pivot tables that isolate usernames, time/date, and the text of tweets for further analysis. 

First, to see how Cristiano Ronaldo engages with his followers on twitter, I made a pivot table of the replies to each username, which I called "replies to username" on the spreadsheet. At first glance, it seems like Ronaldo spends some time responding directly to his fans. From approximately 800 tweets, 77 were replies to other twitter users, or about one for every ten tweets. By creating a "value" column, I also noticed that Ronaldo rarely replies to the same user twice. In a space of nearly two years, Ronaldo only tweeted the same user -- JensonButton -- more than once. JensonButton's user page indicates that he is a racecar driver based in Monaco with his own massive twitter following of over 2 million. This user's visibility may be a reason why Ronaldo engaged in a conversation with him, rather than responding once to a tweet. It seems that, when interacting with his followers, Ronaldo aims for scope rather than depth. By this, I mean that he prefers to send single tweets to as many followers as possible than send multiple tweets to a smaller group of followers. 

Given this insight, I next wanted to know the nature of the interactions Ronaldo has with his fans -- that is, what Ronaldo talks about in his messages to followers. To figure this out, I had to look at the text of the tweets themselves. Because I'm not very experienced with excel, I could not isolate the tweets that were replies to followers, so I had to create a pivot table containing the text from the entire sample of 800 tweets, which I called "text of tweets" on the spreadsheet. 

This move brought about two interesting insights. First, I realized that, in fact, I was able to isolate the replies to followers, because the pivot table organized all tweets in alphabetical order, and all replies began with the "@" symbol. Second, while scanning through the rest of the alphabatized list, I noticed that Ronaldo employs a series of predictable formulas for interacting with his followers. For the tweets that are in reply, it seems like they fit into one of two types: either Ronaldo is greeting a follower while addressing the country, for example "Hello Venezuela" or "Hi Norway," or he is expressing thanks for support to a particular follower. Here, Ronaldo choses one follower as a placeholder to address his greeting to an entire country and his fans. 

The second insight concerns the way that Ronaldo switches between his three main languages. I noticed that among these replies, and his tweets in general, Ronaldo alternates English, Portuguese, and Spanish. These languages make sense, because English is widely known, Portuguese is his native language, and Spanish is the official language in the Madrid club team for which Ronaldo plays. Being at least conversant in all three languages, I was able to do some cursory analysis of the formulas Ronaldo uses to address foreign language audiences. By far, Ronaldo tweets in English. His tweets in English mostly pose questions or make suggestions, like "check out" "want to" or "have you," which seem to be commercially driven, drawing attention to one of his many products or to his team's performance. His tweets in Portuguese are less numerous, and mostly ask the followers for predictions on the upcoming match. His tweets in Spanish are also closely associated with his matches. From this overview, I think it's fair to say that Ronaldo tweets in English to promote his personal brand, and in Portuguese and Spanish to promote his gameplay and team. When tweeting to his followers, Ronaldo speaks in their language.
