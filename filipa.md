my data story
Cristiano ronaldo and his engagement with fans. 
From my first glance at the pivot table, it seems like Ronaldo spends a lot of time responding to his fans. From approximately 800 tweets, 77 were replies to other twitter users, or about one out of every ten tweets. Ronaldo rarely ever replies to the same user twice. In a space of nearly two years, Ronaldo only tweeted the same person -- JensonButton -- more than once.
