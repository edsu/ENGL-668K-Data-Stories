For my data story I assembled a [Twitter data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pFjo7Dot9GBaAbJ1LPAfgTnuBENZDOH1PGs9xDQfqYY/edit?usp=sharing) dataset for the poet [Patricia Lockwood](https://twitter.com/TriciaLockwood). I collected 1,592 of her tweets for the period from April 20, 2015 to November 22, 2015. To do this I configured TAGS settings to fetch using the API type `status/user_timeline` for the user TriciaLockwood. Lockwood has tweeted 12,658 times since May 2011, so I wasn't able to get all of her tweets because of the limitations of Twitter's API.

I thought it might be interesting to see who Lockwood corresponds with the most for the time period I was able to collect in, so I created a pivot table (the Correspondence sheet in the Google Sheets document) that listed the people she directed tweets at the most. The top 5 users she corresponded with were:

1. (44) [@cat_beltane](https://twitter.com/cat_beltane) - Gregory Erskine
2. (36) [@DVSblast](https://twitter.com/DVSblast) - [Dimitri Stathas](http://firstwefeast.com/eat/insomniacs-guide-manhattan-dvs/) (Rapper from New York)
3. (30) [@accomodatingly](https://twitter.com/accommodatingly) - [Stephen Burt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Burt) (Harvard Professor)
4. (24) [@PKhakpour](https://twitter.com/PKhakpour) - [Porochista Khakpour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porochista_Khakpour) (Iranian-American writer)
5. (22) [@McKelvie](https://twitter.com/McKelvie) - [Jamie McKelvie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_McKelvie) (British Cartoonist)

I thought it was interesting the the top person she corresponded with didn't seem to be easily googlable even though he has a somewhat distinctive name.  Erskine's profile says he lives in [Louisville, Kentucky](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Louisville,+KY/@38.1884721,-85.9569564,10z) which isn't terribly far from St Louis and Cincinnati, both of which are places Lockwood has lived in the past.  According to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/magazine/the-smutty-metaphor-queen-of-lawrence-kansas.html) she seems to be currently living in Lawrence, Kansas. Perhaps they knew each other in the past and are keeping in touch via Twitter?

The http://lfriendys.com website Erskine has linked from his Twitter profile was [registered](http://whois.domaintools.com/lilfriendys.com) in 2014 using an address in St Louis. So perhaps they knew each other there. It's possible to [search](https://twitter.com/search?q=cat_beltane+tricialockwood) and scan all their public correspondence, which goes back to September 16, 2011.

*Ok, this is starting to feel creepy now.*
