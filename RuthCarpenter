Staking a Claim in the Twitterverse:A Data Story about @HalfPintIngalls 

The Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11H0T0A5HYbKqaFQrlTUQZ7UmjBToq2UkBELddN6Cceg/edit?usp=sharing

My data story begins with pulling tweets from the handle @HalfPintIngalls that belongs to a parody account for author Laura Ingalls Wilder. In order to communicate that parody to followers and build up a community around the account @HalfPintIngalls often balances the historical performance of Laura Ingalls Wilder with contemporary twitter practices. @HalfPintIngalls’ use of the hashtags #followfriday and #ff illustrate that balance between parody and conventional tweeting. Tweets published by @HalfPintIngalls that include #followfriday or #ff fall into three major categories all of which focus on different kinds of community building. #FollowFriday tweets either tag twitter handles for ‘normal’ twitter users, make up handles for people or things that are associated with Little House on the Prairie, or tags handles of other parody accounts of Little House on the Prairie characters. By balancing parody with contemporary twitter tagging @HalfPintIngalls manages to create a community that jumps between the 21st and the 19th century. 
Of course, analyzing the ‘purpose’ for the hashtags @HalfPintIngalls uses is not possible just by the data, but the frequency that both hashtags occur suggests @HalfPintIngalls at least thought they were worth using as a way to interact with the twitter community. The data for @HalfPintIngalls on TAGS explorer lists #followfriday as occurring 12 times  and #ff  occurring 11 times. If these totals are combined together, the tags become the second most used hashtags by @HalfPintIngalls. The other hashtags @HalfPintIngalls uses frequently are often references to trending topics that are adapted to fit into 19th century topics such as  #longwinter and #1880 memories. Similaraly @HalfPintIngalls adapts the #followfriday tweets in small ways to add to the performance of the account. For example, @HalfPintIngalls refers to the account page as her ‘autographbook’ and thanks users for writing her ‘twittergraphs’ such as in these tweets: 

#FollowFriday @Arngrim @gretchenrubin @meghan_daum and @julieklam, who have all written lovely things in my autograph book! Thank you!

#FF thanks for your kind WILDER LIFE Twittergraphs! @kimmiekm @emanney @readingrobin @wendywimmer @jodiwilldare @readinginak @lijak @5m4b

In addition to using the hashtags to respond to twitter users interacting with the page in ways that invite them into the parody, @HalfPintIngalls sometimes uses the tag just to play around with the breach in time and technology the page suggests. 
So, instead of referencing accounts on twitter who have visited or interacted with the page, @HalfPintIngalls turns the tag into a completely new kind of experience. For example, in one #followfriday tweet @HalfPintIngalls, channeling Laura Ingalls Wilder, seems to misunderstand the usage of the term ‘follow.’ Instead of using the tag to highlight new follows they turn it into a tag of travelling along the Oregon trail ‘following’ a train of covered wagons:

 #FollowFriday @coveredwagon @coveredwagon @coveredwagon @coveredwagon @coveredwagon @sparehorses OREGON HERE WE COME!

In another tweet @HalfPintIngalls makes a joke about getting lost in a blizzard and incorporates the tag: 

You really should follow @clothesline if you don't want to get lost out on the prairie in this blizzard. #FollowFriday

The #FollowFriday tag within these tweets becomes more about performing the persona to the audience rather than directly responding to twitter followers. These kinds of tweets, therefore, do a different kind of work to build the community. Instead of interacting directly with followers the tag invites them into the world the account parodies playing creating a new context for the tag that is used in a particular way by people on twitter.
	The last way @HalfPintIngalls uses #ff and #FollowFriday is to follow handles of characters within the Little House series. Again, these tweets exist on the border or parody and active community building because sometimes they include handles created by users who seem to have very little to do with Little House on the Prairie and other times they are connected to similar parody accounts. For example, the following tweet’s handles lead to accounts whose owners seem to be unaware of their significance to Little House on the Prairie:

#FollowFriday @Farmerboy @Almanzo @Manly @Farmer_Boy @DeanBLegacy

Of course, it is impossible to tell just from the data how much @Farmerboy or the other’s meant to, or not, to refer to the Little House on the Prairie franchise, but certainly none of them are set up as parody accounts like @HalfPintIngalls. Other tweets that @HalfPintIngalls uses the hashtags in do refer to accounts of twitter users who have similar parody accounts i.e. this tweet:

#FF Folks from the "TV show," whatever that is: @Mr_Ingalls @Mrs_Ingalls @ISAIAH_EDWARDS and especially @WillieOleson

Unlike the previous tweet, each of these handles leads to a parody account similar to @HalfPintIngalls’. However, the first three accounts are users who represent a community of parody accounts that are grouped together under an affiliated website twitterhouse.com. These users all reference each other in their bios and their account name is followed by a *TH*, even though @HalfPintIngalls may not be integrated within the *TH* community by following those accounts they tie together the smaller communities of users who set up parody accounts of Little House characters. By ‘following’ these real and fake accounts of Little House people @HalfPintan interest in building a community of not just ‘regular’ twitter users but also a ‘fake’ community of those playing along with the Little House on the Prairie performance. 
	Following the story of the #followfriday and #ff tags reveals the many different communities that exist on twitter for users to interact with. @HalfPintIngalls accesses these communities by adopting the role of Laura Ingalls Wilder and adapting 21st century technologies into topical and relevant 19th century ones. Therefore, although @HalfPintIngalls uses conventional tags they are specially curated and contextualized for the account which allows @HalfPintIngalls, in turn, to customize, or even hack, the twitter experience for the users who interact with the account. Community building, in this instance, becomes just as much about  staking a claim, as @HalPintIngalls might say, in the twitterverse as creating an open and welcoming space for followers.
