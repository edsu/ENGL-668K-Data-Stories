Erik Larson is an American journalist and writer of nonfictions. His books such as *In the Garden of Beasts* (2011) and *The Devil in the White City* (2003) have been recognized as *The New York Times* bestsellers. The latter title, should you be interested, was nominated as a finalist for the 2003 National Book Award and its film adaptation has been discussed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Recently, Lason’s *Dead Wake* (2015) was voted as the winner of goodreads choice awards 2015, the best history and biography category. Winning the first prize of the goodreads—a digital platform where [40 million individual readers](http://www.goodreads.com/about/us) rate and recommend books—must have felt good. [By gaining 22,427 votes](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-history-biography-books-2015)—that is, 9,622 votes more than the second-place title—no less. Larson expressed his gratitude via his Twitter account [on December 1st](https://twitter.com/exlarson/status/671688473561194496), on the day of announcement, and thanked the voters again [on December 3rd](https://twitter.com/exlarson/statuses/672408936943886336). 


As of December 6th, the timing for making the inquiry about Larson and his associates’ Twitter activities concerning the award seems just about right. [According to TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/help/faq/), Twitter Search API retrieves search results only from the last 6-9 days. This regulation sets the date range of my inquiry between November 28th to December 6th, covering, conveniently for the purpose of my analysis, the dates pre and post announcement. Should I conduct the same search via TAGS a week from today, I would not be able to capture the immediate reactions of interested parties to the award.


The search term “exlarson” is chosen with a hope of retrieving the tweets sent to and from Larson. During the last nine days, there have been 276 tweets that include the term “exlarson.” Most frequent tweeter was Larson (61 tweets), followed by 4 tweets by Rich (@fergtweets) and Lindsey Fitzharris (@DrLindseyFitz). There were also 3 tweets respectively by Vince Guerrier (@vinceguerrieri), ScoTT E (@Tex2WestSeattle), Sant Louis University Bookstore (@SLUBooks), Maria Konnikova (@mkonnikova), John Osalvo (@jojokejohn), Christy Fetcher (@FletcherChris), and Curtis Gander (@curt4317). Given the frequency, can they be contributing to the formation of the goodreads choice award fame? Below are some example stories:


All I can speculate about ScoTT E, from his Twitter account, is his (supposedly favorite) list of sport teams: “Longhorns, Mavs, Rangers, Cowboys.” [A tweet posted on December 2nd by Scott E](https://twitter.com/Tex2WestSeattle/statuses/672234503138492416) is a response to the CNN clip Larson posted: “Former GOP congressman flips on support for gun violence research.” It is not about the award. ScoTT E’s remaining two tweets—although the reconstructed data schema of TAGS would not tell—come from one thread. On December 1st, the day of award announcement, ScoTT E joined the conversation between Larson and his fan by [sparring Larson to write at a faster speed](https://twitter.com/Tex2WestSeattle/statuses/671814095557947392). Larson “liked” this tweet at 6:12pm. Did Larson find this funny? He must have. Larson replied by embedding ScoTT E’s last tweet with [a joke](https://twitter.com/Tex2WestSeattle/statuses/671830773918384128): “Did my agent put you up to this?” ScoTT E, in return, “liked” this at 7:18pm. “Likes,” I must report, however, are not traceable via TAGS and are only perceived by following the “status_url” in my attempt to contextualize less-than-140-letters texts.


John Osalvo who likewise figures three times has an impressive numbers of followers—131,263. This number ranks him in the top three; following 282,378 of Amazon Books (@amazonbooks) and 220,776 of a TV network channel C-SPAN Book TV (@BookTV). Who is he? It turns out that Osalvo is a toy collector and dealer. Eyeballing 829 accounts Larson follows tells me that Larson decided to follow Osalvo soon after he opened the account back in 2012. Do they know each other? Larson’s blog suggests he has a small windowsill toy collection. In fact, Larson writes about his toys in [reference to Virginia Woolf’s writing practice](http://eriklarsonbooks.com/about-the-author/the-authors-lair/) and his [nunzillas and other dolls](https://twitter.com/exlarson/status/649593278308814848) keep reappearing throughout his tweets when I look beyond the dates TAGS can fetch. Does this mean Larson is a customer of Osalvo? TAGS tells me that three of the tweets from Osalvo were sent on December 1st. [One tweet’s text is apparently a toy advertisement](https://twitter.com/jojokejohn/statuses/671482187078754304). Can Osalvo trying to sell some toys as Larson celebrates the award? The timestamps of TAGS, however, are according to GMT, London time. Following the “status_url” tells me that this commercial tweet was sent on November 30, at 8:13pm. The other tweet sent from Osalvo at 8:22pm on the same day is [in reply to Larson’s reposting Osalvo’s political joke](https://twitter.com/jojokejohn/statuses/671484366359367680). Are they friends? The third tweet occurred sometime between the aforementioned two. Could this help me connect the dots? Unfortunately, it only enhances my puzzling. The post reads: [“@exlarson good luck suing the Kochs”](https://twitter.com/jojokejohn/statuses/671482749467791360) What are they talking about? I have no idea.


Single tweets that occurred during the last nine days do not do my narrative a favor either. These are the tweets that are either [addressed to Larson](https://twitter.com/AngieMcMonigal/status/671373267882647552) or mentions him in [an embedded manner](https://twitter.com/BeeBagLady/statuses/671707264235929600) or [two](https://twitter.com/curtiscallaway/statuses/671134565491191808). I call them single tweets, for TAGS indicates “blank” for “in_reply_to_screen_name.” It is too quick to assume, however, that they are monolithic lone-standing tweets. Among them are the ones Larson “liked” and the ones Larson (or anybody else for that matter) did not acknowledge in any perceivable ways. Topics among these tweets, moreover, are as wide as the examples shown above. All these analysis, once again, can only be made by clicking the individual “status_url.” Who would have thought that fourteen individual accounts with fourteen different “status_url” would direct me to the same post by *The Amazon Book Review*: [“Celebrity Picks: Erick Larson’s Favorite Reads of 2015”](http://www.omnivoracious.com/2015/11/celebrity-picks-erik-larson-amazon-book-review.html) posted on November 18th. That’s right: all repost gains unique URL that redirects me to [a single tweet](https://twitter.com/amazonbooks/status/670771160104087552) by Amazon Books. Dare I suspected Amazon’s pesky business? Yes, as all predetermined narrative is quick to assume and seeks for its evidence. 


My desire to construct the narrative around how a writer celebrates an award, and according to the twitter records assembled by TAGS, does not seem to be met. And, perhaps, rightly so. (991 words)
